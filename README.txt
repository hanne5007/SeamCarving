1. 1_r20_c15.jpg is obtained from 1.jpg after removing 20 rows and 15 columns. Same applies to other images.

2. run.py
Run run.py would generate the 1_r20_c15.jpgï¼Œ and output_seam.gif, where 20 rows and 15 columns are removed from 1.jpg. 
To generate new seam carving images, it needs to change the filename for the starting images. Also, adjust the resizing parameters if necessary.
